# GoBarber

## Description

Gobar is an application that aims to solve the problem of time reservation management in barbers and hairdressers. For this, it is necessary to create a user, who can be a customer or service provider. Once the user is created, it is possible to log in with your email and password and have access to the application dashboard. In the dashboard, it is possible to visualize the professionals available, and consult their free hours for attendance. Finally, it is possible to make a reservation with the chosen professional.
